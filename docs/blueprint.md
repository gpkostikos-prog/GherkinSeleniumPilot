- Test Execution: Enable users to execute the generated Selenium definitions within the app using a connected Selenium environment (hub/node configuration)
- Results Display: Display the results of the Selenium test execution, including any errors or failures.
- Definition Download: Allow users to download the generated Selenium definitions as a file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight important actions and results.
- Use a monospace font for code snippets and Gherkin input.
- Use a clear and structured layout with distinct sections for input, output, and results.
- Use simple icons to represent actions like "generate", "execute", and "download".
